Setup & Dependencies
--------------------
I haven't had a chance to test this out on a machine that isn't already running the JDK. If there are issues getting the
code to compile and run, please reach out to me: reeesheee@gmail.com


How to run
----------
What's you're setup, running it is pretty simple

Pretty simple: ./gradlew clean run

The gradle wrapper should automatically pull down any dependencies you need to run the code.


How to test
-----------
Running all tests: ./gradlew clean test
